# Employee Analytics Dashboard

**Project Overview**  
This project is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that analyzes employee data to provide actionable insights for HR and management teams. It focuses on workforce demographics, salary distribution, diversity, turnover trends, and performance metrics.

> The goal of this project is to **turn raw HR data into actionable insights**, demonstrating practical data analysis skills and creating a strong portfolio project.

## Problem
Based on the data analysis, HR faces several challenges:
- **High turnover** in HR and among employees aged 40, impacting team stability and increasing hiring/training costs.
- **Salary disparities** between age groups and departments, potentially causing dissatisfaction.
- **Lack of diversity balance** in some departments, e.g., Asian employees concentrated in IT, which may affect inclusion.

---

## Analysis
Using Power BI (and optionally SQL), the following analyses were conducted:
1. **Demographics:** Gender, age, and ethnicity distribution across departments.
2. **Compensation:** Annual salary and bonus distribution by department and age group.
3. **Turnover:** Employee attrition trends across departments, age groups, and ethnicities.
4. **Department Analysis:** Employee count by role and department.
5. **Geographic Analysis:** Workforce distribution across countries.

---

## Key Insights
1. **Gender Distribution:** Females represent a higher proportion of the workforce.
2. **Annual Salary:** HR and older age groups have the highest annual salaries.
3. **Turnover Rate:** HR department has the highest turnover; the Black employee group also shows higher attrition.
4. **Ethnicity by Department:** Asian employees are the majority in the IT department.
5. **Department Size:** Managers have the highest number of employees.
6. **Age & Turnover:** Employees aged 40 have the highest turnover rate.
7. **Country Distribution:** The United States has the largest workforce.
8. **Highest Average Salary by Age:** Employees aged 28 have the highest average annual salary.

## Solution
Based on the insights:
- Implement **custom career development plans** for high-turnover groups (HR and employees aged 40).
- Adjust **salary and bonus structures** to reduce disparities between departments and age groups.
- Promote **diversity and inclusion programs** in departments with concentrated ethnic groups.
- Use the **interactive dashboard** to continuously monitor turnover and salary trends and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.
