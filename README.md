Employee Analytics Dashboard

Project Overview
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes employee data to provide actionable insights for HR and management teams. It focuses on workforce demographics, salary distribution, diversity, turnover trends, and performance metrics.

The goal of this project is to turn raw HR data into actionable insights, demonstrating practical data analysis skills and creating a strong portfolio project inspired by Mo Chen’s approach to building multiple real-world projects.

Problem

Based on the data analysis, HR faces several challenges:

High turnover in HR and among employees aged 40, impacting team stability and increasing hiring/training costs.

Salary disparities between age groups and departments, potentially causing dissatisfaction.

Lack of diversity balance in some departments, e.g., Asian employees concentrated in IT, which may affect inclusion.

Analysis

Using Power BI (and optionally SQL), the following analyses were conducted:

Demographics: Gender, age, and ethnicity distribution across departments.

Compensation: Annual salary and bonus distribution by department and age group.

Turnover: Employee attrition trends across departments, age groups, and ethnicities.

Department Analysis: Employee count by role and department.

Geographic Analysis: Workforce distribution across countries.

Key Insights

Gender Distribution: Females represent a higher proportion of the workforce.

Annual Salary: HR and older age groups have the highest annual salaries.

Turnover Rate: HR department has the highest turnover; the Black employee group also shows higher attrition.

Ethnicity by Department: Asian employees are the majority in the IT department.

Department Size: Managers have the highest number of employees.

Age & Turnover: Employees aged 40 have the highest turnover rate.

Country Distribution: The United States has the largest workforce.

Highest Average Salary by Age: Employees aged 28 have the highest average annual salary.

Solution

Based on the insights:

Implement custom career development plans for high-turnover groups (HR and employees aged 40).

Adjust salary and bonus structures to reduce disparities between departments and age groups.

Promote diversity and inclusion programs in departments with concentrated ethnic groups.

Use the interactive dashboard to continuously monitor turnover and salary trends and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.

Outcomes

HR can identify high-risk turnover groups and take targeted retention actions.

Salary and bonus structures are now more transparent, helping management ensure fairness.

Departments and roles with highest attrition are highlighted for immediate attention.

Management can make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and workforce planning.

Tools Used

Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

SQL (optional): For data cleaning and aggregation.

Next Steps

Add predictive analytics to forecast employee attrition.

Include department-level KPIs to connect HR insights with business outcomes.
